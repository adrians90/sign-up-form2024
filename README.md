**Sign-up-form2024**

This exercise is a simple sign up form built in order to practice basic form validation.
The Odin Project link:

The code checks if name, last name are longer than one character and if the passwords match. It throws an error each time the input is wrong and doesn't submit the form until all fields are filled correctly.
